This is a python script that will make viewing a directory full of images easier.


USAGE

Place index.cgi in a directory full of images.  At it's most basic, It will display those images on a page when called.
But that isn't the point.

Add a directory under index.cgi called "thumbs" and create a thumbnail in it for all of your images. preface these 
file names with thumb_

For example:

/var/www/example/htdocs/gallery/:

./image_1.jpg
./image_2.jpg
./image_3.jpg
./thumbs
./thumbs/thumb_image_1.jpg
./thumbs/thumb_image_2.jpg
./thumbs/thumb_image_3.jpg

You can also create a directory for NEF (raw) files in a similar way.


./var/www/example/htdocs/gallery/:

./image_1.jpg
./image_2.jpg
./image_3.jpg
./thumbs
./thumbs/thumb_image_1.jpg
./thumbs/thumb_image_2.jpg
./thumbs/thumb_image_3.jpg
./raw
./raw/image_1.NEF
./raw/image_2.NEF
./raw_image_3.NEF

etc. etc.

Enjoy!
